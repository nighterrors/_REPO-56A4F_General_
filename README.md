# <[>@Title</]>
<[>@IntroRm</]>
<[>This is a general purpose repo template.</]>
<[>Currently includes the following:
- A README.md
- A CONTRIBUTING.md
- Issue templates for:
	- Bug report
	- Feature request
</]>
<[>
Planned content:
- Expansion of CONTRIBUTING.md with more coding guidlines for:
	- CSS
	- JS
	- And later others (SQL, python comes to mind).
- SECURITY.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- More issue templates?
- More .github files - eventually
- Folder hierarchy (if that prooves to be useful)
- *A script of some sort, that automagically sets up a repo that was based on this template.*
</]>
<[>
Not going to include:
- LICENSE.md - Since that would be inherited too AFAIK, which might not be desirable.

## Getting <[>@It</]>
<[>Basically you can just [clone it](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_.git)</]>

See [full documentation](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/wiki)
<[>Spoiler: It's empty. - This is just a template after all.</]>

### Building it from source
<[>There's nothing to build here.</]>

<[>@HowToBuild</]>

## Using <[>@It</]>
<[>@HowToUse</]>
<[>
1. [Create a repo based on this template.](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/generate)
2. Replace text in double brackets with your content.
	- Except the ones in the isue templates!
	- Perhaps there will be a script, that automates this process to some extent. (`@` symbols followed by CamelCase words will be used as keywords. There'll be like a JSON or something that you'll be able to customize. The name was chosen so that it's easy to capture and replace.)
3. ???
4. Profit.
</]>

## Getting help
<[>If you need help with this template, head to the [forum's Q&A section](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/discussions/categories/q-a)!</]>

1. Start with the [documentation](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/wiki).
2. Look around in the [forum Q&amp;A](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/discussions/categories/q-a).
	1. Hopfully there's already an answer for your question.
	2. If there isn't, but at least someone else has asked the same question, please **bump** theirs, as opening a new thread will only decrease both of y'all chanses of getting an answer.
	3. However, if your question is brand new, then by all means, open a new thread and ask away! Surly, someone will find a solution! - Eventually.
