<?>

<?/?>

<?>
Currently includes the following:
- A [README.md](/README.md "Read Me")
- A [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md "How to contribute")
- Issue templates for:
	- [Bug report](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md "bug report template")
	- [Feature request](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/suggestion.md "suggestion template")
<?/?>

<?>
Planned content:
- Expansion of [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md "How to contribute") with more coding guidelines for:
	- CSS
	- JS
	- And later others (SQL, python comes to mind).
- [SECURITY.md](/SECURITY.md "Security Policy")
- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md "Code of Conduct")
- More issue templates?
- More [.github](/.github ".github folder") files - eventually
- Folder hierarchy (if that proves to be useful)
- *A script of some sort, that automagically sets up a repo that was based on this template.*
	- Config files for aforementioned script.
<?/?>

<?>
Not going to include:
- LICENSE.md - Since that would be inherited too AFAIK, which might not be desirable.

<?/?>

<?>
@HowToGet[^[0]^](#usage "usage") @It[^[0]^](#usage "usage")
<?/?>

See [full documentation](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/wiki "Wiki")

<?>
>	Spoiler: It's empty. - This is just a template after all.
<?/?>

### Installation

<?>
No need to install it.
<?/?>

<?>

## Usage

<?>
@HowToUse
<?/?>

<?>
1. [Create a repo based on this template.](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/generate "Generate from this template")
2. **Replace *text between `<?>` and `<?/?>` marks* with your content.**
	- Perhaps there will be a script, that automates this process to some extent.
	- [0]: `@` symbols followed by CamelCase words are used as keywords. There'll be like a JSON or something that you'll be able to customize.
	- Paragraphs between `<?>` and `<?/?>` marks not containing aforementioned keywords are only part of the template's documentation. They should be deleted during initialization.
	- The repo's name was chosen so that it's easy to capture and replace.
3. ???
4. Profit.
<?/?>

<?>
This repo comes with 3 major branches:
1. `main` - For active development. *Merges into `test`.*
2. `test` - You've guessed it, for testing. *Merges into `prod`.*
3. `prod` - For releases.

And 3 types of side branches are supported:
- `feat/[feature's name]` - For feature development. *Merges into `main`.*
- `bgfx/[bug track id]` - For bug fixes. *Merges into `main` or `test`.*
- `htfx/[bug track id]` - For hot fixes. *Merges into `prod`.*

## Community Standards

Before interacting with our community, please take a moment and read our [community standards](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md "Code of Conduct")!

<?>
>	Spoiler: There are none:( - This is just a template, remember?
<?/?>

## Getting help

<?>
If you need help with this template, head to the [forum's Q&A section](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/discussions/categories/q-a "Discussions / Q&A")!
<?/?>

1. Start with the [documentation](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/wiki "Wiki").
2. Look around in the [forum Q&amp;A](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/discussions/categories/q-a "Discussions / Q&A").
	1. Hopefully there's already an answer for your question.
	2. If there isn't, but at least someone else has asked the same question, please **bump** theirs, as opening a new thread will only decrease both of y'all chances of getting an answer.
	3. However, if your question is brand new, then by all means, open a new thread and ask away! Surly, someone will find a solution! - Eventually.

## Opening Issues

<?>
This applies to this template too:
<?/?>

Before opening a new ticket, please [check if there's already one](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/issues?q=is%3Aissue "Query all issues")!

- Please [report bugs](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%3CBUG%3E+ "Open bug report") &lt;- there!
	- **Security issues should be reported privately to the [repository owner](https://github.com/nighterrors "Nighterrors' profile")!**
		:	A repository owner may choose to publish contact info for sensitive communication on their profile, instead of putting it in every readme and it's commit history. For it's easier to maintain and less permanent.
- If you have a [suggestion or idea](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=suggestion.md&title=%3CIMP%3E+ "Open feature request"), do not hesitate to tell us! We literally thrive on feedback and especially constructive criticism! (No sarcasm intended.)
