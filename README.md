This is a general purpose repo template.
<?/?>

<?>
@IntroRm<sup><a title="Usage" href="#KeyWord">[0]</a></sup>
<?/?>

<?>
Currently includes the following:
- A README.md
- A CONTRIBUTING.md
- Issue templates for:
	- Bug report
	- Feature request
<?/?>

<?>
Planned content:
- Expansion of CONTRIBUTING.md with more coding guidlines for:
	- CSS
	- JS
	- And later others (SQL, python comes to mind).
- SECURITY.md
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
- More issue templates?
- More .github files - eventually
- Folder hierarchy (if that prooves to be useful)
- *A script of some sort, that automagically sets up a repo that was based on this template.*
<?/?>

<?>
Not going to include:
- LICENSE.md - Since that would be inherited too AFAIK, which might not be desirable.

1. [Create a repo based on this template.](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/generate)
2. **Replace *text between `<?>` and `<?/?>` marks* with your content.**
	- Perhaps there will be a script, that automates this process to some extent.
	- <span id="KeyWord">\[0\]: `@` symbols followed by CamelCase words will be used as keywords. There'll be like a JSON or something that you'll be able to customize.</span>
	- The repo's name was chosen so that it's easy to capture and replace.
3. ???
4. Profit.

2. Look around in the [forum Q&amp;A](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/discussions/categories/q-a).
	1. Hopfully there's already an answer for your question.
	2. If there isn't, but at least someone else has asked the same question, please **bump** theirs, as opening a new thread will only decrease both of y'all chanses of getting an answer.
	3. However, if your question is brand new, then by all means, open a new thread and ask away! Surly, someone will find a solution! - Eventually.
