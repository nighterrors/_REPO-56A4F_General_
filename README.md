## Getting help

1. Start with the [documentation](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/wiki).
2. Look around in the [forum Q&amp;A](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/discussions/categories/q-a).
	1. Hopfully there's already an answer for your question.
	2. If there isn't, but at least someone else has asked the same question, please **bump** theirs, as opening a new thread will only decrease both of y'all chanses of getting an answer.
	3. However, if your question is brand new, then by all means, open a new thread and ask away! Surly, someone will find a solution! - Eventually.
