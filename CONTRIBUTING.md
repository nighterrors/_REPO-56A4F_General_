### Branch Hierarchy

<?>
This repo comes with 3 major branches:
1. [`main`](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/tree/main) - For active develoopment. *Merges into `test`.*
2. [`test`](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/tree/test) - For testing. *Merges into `prod`.*
3. [`prod`](https://github.com/nighterrors/_REPO-56A4F_General_/tree/prod) - For releases.

And 3 types of side branches:
- `feat/[feature's name]` - For feature develoopment. *Merges into `main`.*
- `bgfx/[bug track id]` - For bug fixes. *Merges into `main` or `test`.*
- `htfx/[bug track id]` - For hot fixes. *Merges into `prod`.* 
<?/?>


#### Workflow

<?>
1. Development happens on separate *Feature* branches (`feat/[feature's name]`).
2. Once a feature is complete, it's merged into `main`. 
3. When a development phase is complete, `main` is merged into `test`, where the testing takes place.
4. Once all tests are passed, `test` merged into the default branch: `prod`, thus concluding that phase.

-	Bug fixes branch out from wherever they were discovered and merged into either:
	-	`main` if they were discovered during development phase;
	-	Also `main` if the fix will be part of the next `major` or `minor` realease.
	-	or `test` if it'll be part of a `patch` release.
-	Hot fixes similar to bug fixes have their independent branches. But unlike the former they -after careful testing- merge directly into `prod`, bumping the patch version.

0. Here we have our three base branches: <b0>main</b0> <b1>test</b1> and <b2>prod</b2>.
0. Development started on two side-branches: <b3>feat/some_feature</b3>, <b4>feat/some_other_feature</b4>.
0. After those features were completed, they were merged back to <b0>main</b0>.
1. Then development started on <b5>feat/new_feature_1</b5>.
0. In the meantime <b0>main</b0> was merged into <b1>test</b1>.
0. After thorough testing, <b1>test</b1> was merged into <b2>prod</b2>, which marked the release of ==v1.0.0==.
1. Development started on <b6>feat/new_feature_2</b6>.
1. After completing the new features, they were merged back into <b0>main</b0>.
1. Again, <b0>main</b0> was merged into <b1>test</b1>.
1. After passing the tests, <b1>test</b1> was merged into <b2>prod</b2>, thus releasing ==v1.1.0==.

<?/?>

1. During the life-cycle of ==v1.2.1== a bug (<b3>ID: #3</b3>) was discovered.
1. It needed a quick solution, so fixing it started on <b3>htfx/3</b3>.
1. Luckily, it was an easy fix, so after testing it was merged into <b2>prod</b2> and released as ==v1.2.2==.

2. During the life-cycle of ==v1.3.0== another bug (<b4>ID: #4</b4>) was discovered.
2. It too needed a quick soulution, so develpoment started on <b4>htfx/4</b4>.
2. But unlike the previous bug <b4>it</b4> prooved to be more complicated, so based on <b4>it</b4>'s urgency, a workaround was implemented.
2. After testing, <b4>it</b4> was merged into <b2>prod</b2> and released as ==v1.3.1==
2. In the meantime, a more permanent solution was developed on <b5>bgfx/4</b5>.
2. <b5>It</b5> was merged int the <b0>main</b0> development cycle of ==v1.4== and finally released as part of ==v1.4.0==.

3. With the release of ==v1.4.1== a bug (<b6>ID: #5</b6>) was introduced.
3. Fixing <b6>it</b6> started on <b6>bgfx/5</b6>.
3. Soon turned out, a permanent soulution required features not yet implemented.
3. So a quick workaround was delevoped on <b7>htfx/5</b7>.
3. <b7>It</b7> was released as ==v1.4.2==.
3. In the meantime, development of a permanent solution contiued on <b6>bgfx/5</b6>. And eventually released with ==v1.5.0==.

## Coding Style

### Based on

- [WordPress Coding Standards](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards#Indentation)

#### See also

- [Clean Code Explained](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/clean-coding-for-beginners/)
- [I Shall Call It.. SomethingManager](https://blog.codinghorror.com/i-shall-call-it-somethingmanager/)

### Key rules

#### General

0. *Indentation should reflect logical structure.*

	:	Duh.

0. ***Use <kbd>tab</kbd> characters to indent lines!***

	:	**Tabs are flexible.** Either you prefer 2 or 4 spaces per indention level(, or any other uncommon number), using tabs lets you set up your editor to render them as short or as long as you like it. And it doesn't matter if your friends / colleagues prefer it differently, y'all can allways collaborate on the same file and still have it rendered the way you like it.

	:	Using tabs saves you at least 1 B per character;)

	:	I haven't found any -good- reason not to.

0. **Comments should start at the same indent as the line they belong to.**

	:	It looks nice and structured.

0. *Prefer descriptive names over explanations.*

	:	It'll help remebering what it does, without having to find where it was explained.

	:	It'll also help others better understand the code.

0. *But describe what needs to be in comments.*

	:	This helps understand the code that was written a long time ago.

	:	But also helps others, who would like to collaborate or just having issues with the code. Especially if they aren't programmers.

	:	Also quite invaluable in debugging.

	:	*So please explain what each block of code supposed to do!*

0. *Use comments to further structure your code* by adding titles to sections.

	:	Helps readability and finding relevant parts of the code.

#### HTML

6. **Close self-closing elements with ` />`.**

	:	For XML compatibility.

	>	As per W3C recommendation, these tags should be closed with exactly one space followed by a forward slash.

6. **Booleans in HTML should be in short form.**

	:	To improve readability.

	!!! hint ""
		E.g.: ✅`defer` instead of ❌`defer=true`.

6. **Attribute values should always be quoted.**

	:	For XML compatibility.

	:	And to avoid errors.

6. **Use single quote `'` for well known keywords.**

	:	To help distinguish them.

	!!! hint ""
		E.g.: `<html lang='en' >`.

6. **But double quotes `"` for arbitrary strings.**

	:	To help distinguish keywords from.

	!!! hint ""
		E.g.: `<a href="github.com" >`.

6. **Tags, attributes and keywords should be lowercase.**

	:	To help distinguish text intended for humans vs. machines.

	>	All tags and attributes must be lowercase. Plus any keyword interpreted by machines, except arbitrary names likes variables, classes, IDs, etc..

	!!! hint ""
		E.g.: `<link rel='icon' type='image/icon' href="favicon.ico" />`.

6. **Attribute order:**

	:	It helps finding relevant parts of tags with a lot of attributes.

	:	Keeps things nice and organized.

	1. Class
	2. ID
	3. Title
	4. ... Others ...
	5. Booleans
	6. Link (`href`, `src`, etc.)

	!!! info ""
		From left to right: IDs from more general to the most specific.
	!!! info ""
		Leftmost: Most important attribute.

#### CSS

<!--TODO-->

#### JS

<!--TODO-->

##### Naming convention

13. **Use CapitalCamelCase for custom stuff.**

	:	Makes them clearly distinguishable from built-ins.

13. **The first two letters of the name are reserved for classification**

	:	Helps to identify objects and their purpose.

	:	Thus helping with 3), by providing a shorthand description of type and possibly content.

	:	Helps ensure 13).
